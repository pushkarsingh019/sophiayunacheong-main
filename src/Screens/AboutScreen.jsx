          <br />
          <p>
            I am a 24-year-old content creator & community lover based in New
            York
            <br />
            <br />
            I hope to inspire many around the world to live a more fulfilling
            life & follow their path on their own terms.
            <br /> <br /> I value the power of being vulnerable to cultivate the
            strongest relationships with one another as a community. I hope we
            can go through this journey of life together.
